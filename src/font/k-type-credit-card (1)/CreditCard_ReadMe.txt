Credit Card is an ALL CAPITALS font for simulating bank cards (and to suggest a context of banking, finance, membership or security).

The number keys produce the bigger, squarer digits of the 16 figure card number.

There is no lowercase in this font. Instead, the small numerals used for validity dates fill the lowercase letter keys, 1 > 9 being at a > i.

In deference to their functional origins, most characters are monospaced and devoid of pair kerning. Also, many of the accented capital letters are reduced in vertical size to help accommodate the diacritic.
